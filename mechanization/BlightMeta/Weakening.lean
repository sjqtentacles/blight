  Structural lemmas about `HasType` needed before substitution/preservation: checking at ambient
  `0` forces all-zero usage (the mechanized form of §1.1(a)/(d)'s "erasure is total"), and general
  weakening (inserting a fresh, unused binder anywhere in the context) — the ingredient the
  substitution lemma (`Substitution.lean`) needs to shift the substituted term correctly when
  recursing under a binder, mirroring `subst`'s own `shiftAbove 0 s` call in the `lam` case.

/-- **Ambient-zero erasure is total**: if `e` is checked at ambient demand `0`, *every* variable's
    recorded usage is `0` — not just the ones lying in a type-formation/family position (§1.1(a)),
    but literally all of them, since at `σ = 0` the `Var` rule's unit contribution is `0`
    everywhere and no other rule scales usage back up. This is the fact that makes the
    substitution lemma close in the one case where the naive bound `δ ≤ ρ` isn't already enough
    on its own (`σ = 0`, where `σ · ρ = 0` regardless of `ρ`). -/

    already finish it (`σ = 0`, so `σ · ρ = 0` regardless of `ρ`) is exactly where
    `ambient_zero_usage` forces `δ = 0` too — so this is really "`δ ≤ ρ` plus the σ = 0 collapse,"
    combined by a case split on `σ`. This is the mechanized generalization of the "layered

/-- **Dimension weakening**: opening additional dimension binders never invalidates a derivation —
    `d` is pure well-scoping bookkeeping that no rule ever compares against a specific value (only
    `iabs` even mentions it, and only to increment it relative to its own conclusion), so a
    derivation valid with `d` dimensions in scope is just as valid with more. `Substitution.lean`'s
    `iabs` case needs this to make the substituted term's own derivation available one dimension
    deeper, mirroring the ordinary `weaken 0` re-shift its `lam` case already needs for one more
    *term* binder — the exact dimension-side counterpart. -/

/-- **Dimension-count is fully immaterial**: since no rule ever inspects `d`'s concrete value
    (only `iabs` even mentions it, purely to increment it locally for its own premise), a
    derivation valid at any one dimension count is valid at *every* other — strictly stronger than
    `dim_weaken`'s one-directional `d → d + 1` (which only needed the "grows" half). `Progress.lean`
    needs the *other* direction: stepping `.iabs body` to `body` moves from a `d + 1`-deep
    derivation (the `iabs` rule's premise) back down to the ambient `d`, matching the operational
    reading that opening a dimension binder is a complete runtime no-op, not merely a typing one. -/

/-- **General weakening**: inserting a fresh, unused binder anywhere in the context (not just at
    the front) preserves typability, shifting the term (`Tm.shiftAbove`) and usage
    (`insertUsage`) accordingly. This is the ingredient `subst`'s own recursive `lam` case
    (`subst (j+1) (shiftAbove 0 s) body`) needs: substituting under one more binder requires the
    substituted term to be re-weakened one level deeper, which is exactly `weaken _ 0 _`. -/
