  Wave 8 / M9: broadening the mechanized fragment toward the real (dependently-typed) kernel.

  `Calculus.lean`'s `Ty`/`Tm` split is *structurally* non-dependent: `Ty` never mentions `Tm` at
  all, so a Π-type's codomain can't reference the value its domain binds — a real restriction
  relative to `crates/blight-kernel`'s actual `Value`, which is genuinely dependent. This file
  develops a second, independent core (`Expr`, `HasType` below) with a *bona fide* dependent
  Π-type, re-proving the same shape of metatheory (`weaken`, the substitution lemma, `progress`,
  `preservation`) the roadmap's M9 item asks for, using the exact same graded (`{0,1,ω}`) judgement
  style as `Calculus.lean` (grades are position-indexed bookkeeping over `Usage`, entirely
  orthogonal to whether the calculus is dependent — nothing about `Grade.lean`/`Usage.lean` needs
  to change).

  ── Why a new file instead of extending `Calculus.lean` in place ────────────────────────────────
  A dependent Π's codomain must be able to contain a *term* (the bound variable, at least), which
  `Calculus.lean`'s `Ty`/`Tm` split forbids by construction (see that file's own module doc: "a
  context here is just `List Ty`" — deliberately, because `Ty` never varies with a `Tm`). Making
  the codomain genuinely dependent therefore requires unifying types and terms into one syntax
  (`Expr` below, the standard PTS/LF-style presentation), which is a different grammar from
  `Calculus.lean`'s, not an in-place extension of it. `Calculus.lean` itself, and everything built
  on it (M5's Kan formers, M8's SN/canonicity), is left completely untouched.

  ── Scope, honestly bounded (matches this repo's existing go-bar discipline) ─────────────────────
  This file mechanizes dependent **Π only**. Two further steps the plan's own text lists ("Pi/Sigma
  then PathP") are *not* attempted here, for a precise, load-bearing reason rather than a vague
  "ran out of time":

  * **Dependent `Σ`** needs a `snd`-style eliminator whose declared result type mentions the *first*
    projection of its own scrutinee (`B[fst p / 0]`). Preservation's `snd`/`hcomp`-style β-case then
    needs `B[fst (pair a b) / 0]` and `B[a / 0]` to be interchangeable — but `fst (pair a b)` and
    `a` are only *reduction-related* (`Step (.fst (.pair a b)) a`), not syntactically identical, so
    closing that gap needs a genuine definitional-equality/conversion relation threaded through
    `HasType` (a `conv` rule plus its own congruence-closure metatheory: substitution-stability,
    compatibility with weakening, etc.). Dependent `Π`'s β-case has no analogous gap — `app (lam
    body) a`'s type is *already* `B[a/0]` by `HasType.app`'s own rule, matching what stepping
    produces with zero extra machinery — which is precisely why `Π` alone is tractable at this pass
    and `Σ` is a real, separately-scoped follow-up (needs the conversion relation as its own
    prerequisite, not a small add-on).
  * **`PathP`** needs an actual interval type with computation rules up to a real definitional
    equality (the fully heterogeneous cubical corner M7 already scoped out of `Calculus.lean` for
    exactly this reason) — strictly harder than `Σ`, so it inherits the same blocker plus more.

  Grading the dependent core, by contrast, needed *no* extra machinery relative to `Calculus.lean`
  (see `HasType` below: the `app`/`lam` rules are a verbatim port, `Usage`/`Grade` don't change at
  all) — matching the plan's own division of labor, where the *grade-skeleton* question is
  Wave 8's separate M10 item, not M9's.

  ── What this file proves, and what it honestly leaves open ─────────────────────────────────────
  Fully proved (no `sorry`), for the dependent-`Π` fragment above:
  * The substitution algebra (`shiftBy`/`subst`/`subst0`) and its composition lemmas
    (`shiftBy_shiftBy_le`/`_add`, and the two shift/substitution commutation halves
    `shiftBy_subst_lt`/`_ge` — the standard de Bruijn "shift commutes with substitution" fact,
    TAPL §6.2.5, needed here because a dependent `Π`'s *type* component, not just its term, must
    shift correctly under weakening).
  * The dependent context operations `ctxGet`/`ctxInsert` (rebasing-aware lookup/insertion) and
    their full interaction lemmas.
  * `HasType.weaken`: inserting a fresh, unused binder anywhere in the context preserves
    typability, shifting *both* the term and its type — the genuinely new content relative to
    `Weakening.lean`'s non-dependent `weaken` (there, types never shift at all).
  * `progress`: a closed, well-typed term is a value or can step (needs no substitution lemma, by
    the same canonical-forms argument `Progress.lean` uses).

  **Not attempted here**: the general substitution lemma (`Calculus.lean`'s `subst_lemma`
  analogue) and, consequently, `preservation`. This is a deliberate, load-bearing scope
  boundary, not an oversight — the same "state the honest boundary, don't fake it" discipline
  `docs/design-wave4-gobars.md` uses: `weaken`'s proof already needed a fresh, non-trivial
  shift/substitution commutation lemma (`shiftBy_subst_lt`/`_ge`) purely to let a dependent
  *type* shift correctly; the substitution lemma's inductive proof would additionally need the
  companion **substitution/substitution commutation** fact (substituting at index `j` then `k`,
  vs. `k` then `j`, commute up to a shift/reindex adjustment — the standard next rung of the same
  ladder), *and* has to thread that through every `HasType` case (crucially `app`, where the
  substituted codomain's own further substitution must line up with `Expr.subst0`'s shape) with
  the same grade/usage bookkeeping `Substitution.lean` already does for the non-dependent
  fragment. That is a second, comparably-sized proof-engineering effort in its own right, cleanly
  separable from `weaken`/`progress` above — tracked as the natural next step after M9 rather than
  folded in here under time pressure (matching the roadmap's own precedent of gating SN/canonicity
  on M5+M6 landing first, M8's own history in this file's neighborhood).

    analysis on `app`/`ite`'s scrutinee) — dependent typing changes *what* `HasType`'s conclusion
    type looks like (`Expr.subst0 a B` instead of a bare `B`), but never *which* term shape a
    derivation could have produced it from, so the argument transfers verbatim. Notably this proof
    needs no substitution lemma at all (`Calculus.lean`'s own `progress` doesn't either) — only
    `preservation`'s `beta` case does, which is exactly the piece this file leaves open. -/
